# CLIP-Marketplace-Fraud-Image-Classifier

## Overview
The **Marketplace Fraud Image Classifier** project aims to detect fraudulent images in online marketplaces by classifying them as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent. The model is trained to identify images that contain deceptive text, such as "деньги за отзывы телеграм @mony_tg," which are commonly associated with scams.

## Model Architecture

### CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining)
The project utilizes the CLIP model, developed by OpenAI, which is a multimodal neural network designed to understand and relate images and text. CLIP is trained on a large dataset of image-text pairs, allowing it to learn visual concepts from natural language descriptions. This training enables the model to predict which text snippet corresponds to a given image, effectively bridging the gap between visual and textual information.

#### How CLIP Works
- **Multi-Modal Learning**: CLIP consists of two encoders: one for images and another for text. Both encoders map their respective inputs into a shared embedding space.
- **Contrastive Learning**: During training, CLIP learns to maximize the similarity between correct image-text pairs while minimizing the similarity between incorrect pairs. This approach allows the model to generalize well across various tasks without needing task-specific training data.
- **Zero-Shot Capabilities**: After training, CLIP can perform zero-shot classification, meaning it can classify images based on textual descriptions without needing additional fine-tuning.

### CatBoost Classifier
In this project, the embeddings generated by the CLIP model serve as input features for the CatBoost classifier. CatBoost is a gradient boosting algorithm that excels at handling categorical features and provides robust performance in classification tasks.

## Features
- **Fraud Detection**: Classifies images based on the presence of scam-related text and visual features.
- **Text Understanding**: Trained to comprehend the meaning of text within images, enabling effective identification of fraudulent content.
- **Advanced Techniques**: Combines CLIP for feature extraction and CatBoost for classification, leveraging their strengths in handling multimodal data.
